  - Welcome to Rattlescamp, pal  !
  - So, you're the guy they sent to collect our crates ?
  - ...
  - Oh, right, you're the mute one !
  - In any case, here's a refill of ammo for you. Bet you'll need it.
  - So, you're off to deposit this cargo to next camp over.
  - 'Also... '
  - It's a bit embarassing to ask that, but...
  - I was hoping you'd deliver <color=red><b>this additional package</b></color>
    to someone <color=red><b>I deeply care about</b></color>, a little further along
    the Line.
  - I left a note in it. The Quartermaster there knows me, he'll know who's the recipient.
  - I'm not forcing you, you could just deposit it next stop and someone might take
    the job eventually...
  - Well, anyway... I won't keep you further. Good luck out here, pal !
