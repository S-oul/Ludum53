  - Finally ! Took you long enough.
  - We've been waiting for this food for weeks !
  - ...
  - Ah, I see who you are. Well, you deserve some rest, that's for sure. We'll spare
    you a room.
  - ...What ? You've got another errand ?
  - You madlad, have you seen the storm ? The creatures are going to be agitated,
    you'd be crazy to go back out there !
  - ...
  - Well, I mean, who am I to stop you, right ?... We got our food, my concern ends
    here.
  - At least, take some more bullets. Not sure it'll do much help, but it'll keep
    my conscience at ease.
  - Do try to come back from the mist, will you ?
