  - "Hey. Wake up. It\u2019s time for you to go."
  - What, forgot where you put your tongue, already ?
  - "Ah yes\u2026 Am sorry, I forgot. Well, remember, tonight you need to go to Rattles
    Camp. You got some deliveries to do.  Take this UV flashlight. It might come
    in handy. Mange it well, and it should avoid you any trouble. Remember to keep
    the engine powered up if you want to move on."
  - "Just be careful with the surface. We still don\u2019t know how they act. Fly
    over it, all we go fine. But here\u2019s some bullets, in case if the UV lights
    are not enough."
  - And mate, be careful out there.
