  - Hey. Wake up, lad !
  - "It\u2019s time for you to go."
  - ...
  - What, forgot your tongue ? You mute or somethin' ?
  - "...Ah yes\u2026 sorry lad, forgot 'bout that."
  - Well, remember, tonight we need you to Rattlescamp, next station over.
  - Got some cargo to pick up there and deliver further along the way.
  - You know the drill, but no harm in reminders, right ?
  - Whatever's out there can only be seen in the <b><color=yellow>light</b></color>.
  - Your boat's lamp can be rotated using the <b><color=yellow>lever</color></b>.
  - If you're getting attacked, you can <b><color=yellow>focus</color></b> the light
    to fight the creatures.
  - The boat's battery can be recharged by using the <b><color=yellow>pump</color></b>.
  - If it runs out, boat will slow down until it stops, so keep an eye on it !
  - Finally, in case of emergency... well, you know how to use that thing.
  - Bullets go in the chamber. Use them sparingly, as we don't have a heck of a lot
    of them in stock anymore.
  - And lad... I know this ain't your first run, but be careful out there, 'aight
    ?
  - Do come back to us in one piece.
